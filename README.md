# Tkinter-csv2barchat-dataframe
This is a project to read data from CSV file using pandas to display as data frame. which is interpreted as bar chats using matplotlib and displayed in Tkinter GUI 

Hi,
this is vedavyas kota. i am here to explain this project file

in this folder there will be 3 files 
1)data frame
2)bar chat
3)frame and chat


in 'data frame' file the data from CSV will be read using pands and display it in Tkinter GUI as dataframe

Bar graphs are used to compare things between different groups or to track changes over time. 
'bar char' file will display two colums from csv file Eg: 'Customer' and 'Lbl By Days' are taken as default in x,y values. you can change them as you like

'frame and chat' file you will see both bar chat and csv file data as data frame

NOTE: if you need to read different csv file please update path, if you need to display different value in bar chat please change path and column names
